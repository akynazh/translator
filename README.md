# osx-translator

MenuBar Translate is a very simple app that lets you have a quick shortcut to Google Translate in your OS X menu bar and integrate it with the OS X "Services" menu.

NOTE: This project uses the code of [osx-menubar-translate](https://github.com/zetxek/osx-menubar-translate) under the MIT license. I want to customize many styles and features, which may not be consistent with the author's intention, so I decided to develop on my own branch, totally. If possible, I will contribute some meaningful features to the original repository.

My version provides global keyboard shortcuts, a more beautiful interface and icons. More features will be added continuously.

## Global keyboard shortcuts

- activate app: `cmd + e`, configure in `Translator/Constants.swift`
- translate selected text: any, add a keyboard shortcut for the service at "Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Services > Translate Selected Text".
